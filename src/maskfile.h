 * JtR native support for Hashcat's .hcmask files. This 'mode' is
 * driven by option --mask-file=hashfile.  The logic added to JtR
 * is just like HC.  No JtR extensions (like the ?w or using the
 * [Mask] placeholder is used.  The only minor difference is that the
 * ?b mask handles characters from \x1 to \xff while hashcat handles
 * chars from \x0 to \xff.
