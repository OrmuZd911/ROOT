Cracking ENCSecurity DataVault
==============================

1. Run encdatavault2john.py on vault folder.

```bash
$ ../run/encdatavault2john.py path/to/vault > hash
```

2. Run john on the file.

```bash
$ ../run/john hash
```

The decryption test is done on a 32-bit magic value, meaning that occasional 
false positives can occur. Cracked passwords for those false positives will not
decrypt the vault correctly.

The format has been tested on Sony ENCDataVault lite 6.2.13, SanDisk 
SecureAccess 3.02 and ENC DataVault 7.1.1W.

The key derivation problems were patched by Western Digital:
