#rain module by owein, yvain29@gmail.com  

The module uses a state, holding the current character (from the set) for each placeholder (characters of the word as in formal speaking).  


2..... characters  
1..... characters  
0..... ..........  
012345 placeholders  

This is a bruteforce with word's length 6 and set's size 3; so 3^6 words are ouput.  
When doing this on a broad range, you generaly don't want to spend a month testing words that start with aaaa...  
You have several options: use -inc, -markov, or -subsets... and you can use this one: -rain.   

When the length is even it is strafing the index of the state by adding a value to the counter of the loop iterating on the placeholders (words length),  
and cutting it off with a modulo.  
When the loop is done, we increase the strafe variable by 2; Then the variable is fixed with:  
 `if( strafe % (length/2) == 0 ) strafe += 2;`  

Implies length > 1, but the check is done automatically.  

When it's odd the strafe if increased by length/3 for each character in the word, and that is all. It doesn't slide but treats one character on three...

On top of that, a variable is increasing the value of the strafed index and is also cut off.  

The method/technic is called 'rain', but that is quite arbitrary.
