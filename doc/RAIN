#rain module by owein, yvain29@gmail.com  

The module uses a state, holding the current character (from the set) for each placeholder (characters of the word as in formal speaking).  

2..... characters  
1..... characters  
0..... ..........  
012345 placeholders  
This is a bruteforce with word's length 6 and set's size 3; so 3^6 words are ouput.  

When doing this on a broad range, you generaly don't want to spend a month testing words that start with aaaa...  
With jtr, you have several options: use -inc, -markov, or -subsets... and you can use this one: -rain.   

This module is using a strafe on the value of i in the loop on i<length, so that the processing of characters rotate.  
Another thing is that we are rotating the characters being choose from the set, for this purpose another strafing variable is used.  
Instead of being stuck with either only chunks of the words being processed (first method only) or with repetitive patterns(second method only);  
the combination of these two methods creates a truly shattered generation that still falls right.
