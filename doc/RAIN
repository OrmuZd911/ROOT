#rain module by owein, yvain29@gmail.com  

The module uses a state, holding the current character (from the set) for each placeholder (characters of the word as in formal speaking).  


2..... characters  
1..... characters  
0..... ..........  
012345 placeholders  

This is a bruteforce with word's length 6 and set's size 3; so 3^6 words are ouput.  
When doing this on a broad range, you generaly don't want to spend a month testing words that start with aaaa...  
You have several options: use -inc, -markov, or -subsets... and you can use this one: -rain.   

It is strafing the index of the state by adding a value to the counter of the loop iterating on the placeholders (words length) and cutting it off with a modulo.  
When the loop is done, we increase the strafe variable by 2 or 4 with respectively even or odd lengths. Then the variable is fixed with:  
 `if( strafe % (length-2) < 2 ) strafe = 0;`  
In other words it checks for the last character and resets when it's even;  
when it's odd it has to reach length - 2 or length - 1 with steps of 4 so that is harder to explain but it falls right.   

modulo length-2 implies length > 2.  

On top of that, a variable is increasing the value of the strafed index and is also cut off; the same technique is used but the modulo is the character set's  
length and not the length of the word. So the character set must be bigger than 2 too.   

The method/technic is called 'rain', but that is quite arbitrary.
