#rain module by owein, yvain29@gmail.com  

The module uses a state, holding the current character (from the set) for each placeholder (characters of the word as in formal speaking).  

2..... characters  
1..... characters  
0..... ..........  
012345 placeholders  
This is a bruteforce with word's length 6 and set's size 3; so 3^6 words are ouput.  

When doing this on a broad range, you generaly don't want to spend a month testing words that start with aaaa...  
With jtr, you have several options: use -inc, -markov, or -subsets... and you can use this one: -rain.   

We are rotating the characters being choosen from the set, for this purpose a strafing variable is  
increased inside of the loop on the length of the words, and decreased by one  
less iteration and by a value lower by one.   
This creates mangled patterns that are evolving along with the state of the bruteforce.
