#rain module by owein douard, yvain29@gmail.com

This is a combination of a strafe/slide on the index of the state, that represents the position of the character being worked on,
and on the value of the state, that represents the character being picked.
The later being called 'rotate'.

When iterating on a word of even length, the index of the bruteforce state is positionned at each quarter of the word,
if the word is of odd length, the index gets mad and using stdout shows the words sparkling when only the strafe is active.

Both parts of the procedure use a variable that increases differently according to the modulo that cuts it off.
Modulo is a multiple of 10 ? Or a multiple of 2 ? Or is odd. 
This technique comes out of trials and reflections, and the need for different values for odd or even modolus values stands out pretty clear but I could not\
graps the idea of why a modulus value of 10 needs to be taken care differently,
I just end up thinking that it is normal since we are working with decimals, and that's all...

Good luck with your bruteforce.
