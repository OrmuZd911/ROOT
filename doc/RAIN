#rain module by owein douard, yvain29@gmal.com

when iterating on a word of odd length, the indexes are spread so that one character on three is treated,
then the rest evolves according to the slices of indexes...
If you want to have a look at this, comment the line 'rotate[loop] -= mpl - 2 + charcount % 2;' of the file rain.c.
You can note the difference with an even word, where the iteration proceed at the begining and the end.

The rest of the method is a simple rotation of the characters.
