How to get & crack AS/400 hashes?
---------------------------------

Assuming you have been granted access to an AS/400 server with *ALLOBJ and *SECADM privileges 
(or have escalated the privileges to such user), you will be able to download and crack the 
password hashes that are stored on the system. Depending on the current setting of the 
QPWDLVL system value, password hashes are stored in different formats on the AS/400:

QPWDLVL 0:
- IBM DES hashes (not yet supported by JtR*)
- LM hashes (supported by default by JtR)
- SHA1 uppercase hashes (supported by JtR with our 'as400-sha' format plugin )

QPWDLVL 1:
- IBM DES hashes (not yet supported by JtR*)
- SHA1 uppercase hashes (supported by JtR with our 'as400-sha' plugin)

QPWDLVL 2:
- IBM DES hashes** (not yet supported by JtR*)
- LM hashes*** (supported by default by JtR)
- SHA1 uppercase hashes**** (supported by JtR with our 'as400-sha' plugin)
- SHA1 mixed case hashes (supported by JtR with our 'as400-sha' plugin)

QPWDLVL 3:
- SHA1 uppercase hashes**** (supported by JtR with our 'as400-sha' plugin)
- SHA1 mixed case hashes (supported by JtR with our 'as400-sha' plugin)


* Please check our page for updates. We plan to deploy a new DES module for JtR soon.
** Only if QPWDMAXLEN <=10
*** Only if QPWDMAXLEN <=14
*** Depending on password policy configuration

In this tutorial we focus on the LM and SHA1 (both uppercase and mixed case) hashes.
Obviously, if LM hashes are available, go for these as these can be cracked very
efficiently by JtR. If LM hashes are not available, our 'as400-sha' plugin has you
covered ;)


PREREQUISITES
-------------

In order to be able to grab and crack the hashes, you will need:
- the latest version of IBMiScanner (part of hack400tool), available on https://github.com/hackthelegacy/hack400tool
- the latest john the ripper jumbo release including our 'as400-sha' plugin


LM hashes
---------

1. Open IBMiScanner tool
2. Provide at minimum: Username, Password, IP address/DNS name
3. Click "Connect"
4. From the list of available scans, select option 26: SECURITY: Get John the Ripper hashes (LM hash)
5. In the output directory, a file named <systemname>lmhashes.txt will be created.
6. Copy the file to your John the Ripper "run" directory
7. Run john the ripper:
	john --format=LM {filename}
8. Enjoy the passwords :)


SHA-1 hashes
------------

Please note that this method is generic for both mixed and upper case.

1. Open IBMiScanner tool
2. Provide at minimum: Username, Password, IP address/DNS name
3. Click "Connect"
4. From the list of available scans, select option 27: SECURITY: Get John the Ripper hashes (SHA-1 hash uppercase) for uppercase hashes. For mixed case hashes, you can choose for option 28: SECURITY: Get John the Ripper hashes (SHA-1 hash mixed case) respectively.
5. In the output directory, a file named <systemname>SHA-uc-hashes.txt for uppercase hashes or <systemname>SHA-mc-hashes.txt for mixed case hashes will be created.
6. Copy the file to your John the Ripper "run" directory
7. Run john the ripper:
	john --format=as400-sha {filename}
8. Enjoy the passwords :)
